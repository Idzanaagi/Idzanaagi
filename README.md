#### :woman_student: What can you see here: 

[Mind games](https://github.com/Idzanaagi/frontend-project-lvl1) – 5 math games to warm up your brain. It's my first study project. Used ESLint, CodeClimat, Github Action. The main thing that this project gave me was an understanding of how to build an architecture (in this case, launching games) so that this logic is in one place.

[Difference Calculator](https://github.com/Idzanaagi/frontend-project-lvl2) – allows you to compare two configuration files (with json, yaml or yml extension). Second study project. Used Commander, Higher-Order Functions. Recursive traversal of tree structures was difficult for me, but I've overcome it

[RSS aggregator](https://github.com/Idzanaagi/frontend-project-lvl3) – it is necessary to implement downloading and displaying RSS feed data. I'm working on this project right now. Use i18next, webpack, promise. The code is raw and will undoubtedly change (for the better).

[Days without incident](https://github.com/Idzanaagi/daysWithoutIncident) –  my pet project. Console utility count the number of days. To get the result, the user needs to run the utility 2 times. Plans to add the ability to keep multiple counts, see the number of days at the moment (without resetting the current progress).
